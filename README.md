# twotemperatureprobes
This programs takes information from multiple DS18B20 probes and posts their readings to Google Sheets using gspread.

The tempReader.py program is sort of a base level program.  It returns elapsed time, and temperature values for each probe in the terminal.  It is a good place to start if you are just making sure that you are getting times and temperatures correctly.
